# Star Wars API
This program allows you to analyze information about the 'Star Wars' movies from the website 'swapi.dev'. The program allows you to perform two actions:
1. Search for information for a specific term from one of the resources in the API (for user input: search <resource> <term>).
2. Display the planets data sorted according to each selected term - in ascending or descending order (for user input: sort <order_field> <True/False>).
